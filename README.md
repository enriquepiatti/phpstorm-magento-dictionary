Magento Dictionary for PhpStorm
===========================

Overview
-------
Magento has some specific words which PhpStorm fairly marks as typos. This dictionary file solves this issue and keeps your inspector status all green.

Install
-------
Go to "Preferences\Spelling", select "Dictionaries" tab and add path to the directory where `magento.dic` is stored to "Custom Dictionaries Folder" list.

Note
-------
This is an ongoing project. Dictionary is updated one new exceptions are found. Pull requests are appreciated.
